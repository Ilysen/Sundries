			Vanilla logic displays all power cells above 75% charge as {{G|Full}}, even if they aren't at cap. This tweak makes cells at 100% charge appear as {{G|Max}}; anything between 75% and 100% still appears as {{G|Full}} like usual.

			While enabled, failing a Proselytize against a creature will tell you the involved math, as well as the roll you need to succeed. If you're mathematically unable to Proselytize the target, it'll show you by how much.

		DisplayText="Treat all robot limbs as scrap"
		Category="Sundries" Type="Combo" Values="None,All But Faces,All" Default="None">
		<helptext>
			Vanilla logic considers every robotic limb type (arm, leg, different heads, etc) to be separate for the purposes of being treated as scrap.

			This overrides the logic so that marking one robotic limb as scrap will treat all robotic limbs from any NPC type as scrap, with an optional setting to prevent faces from being subjected to the override too.

	<option ID="Ceres_Sundries_TreatModdedItemsAsScrap"
		DisplayText="'Treat as scrap' ignores tinkering mods"
		Category="Sundries" Type="Checkbox" Default="No">
		<helptext>
			Vanilla logic treats every modded combination of an item to be separate for the purposes of being scrap; for instance, marking a lacquered musket as scrap will only treat future lacquered muskets as scrap rather than every musket, for instance. This disables that behavior by checking the object's base type instead, meaning that mods will no longer be considered when determining scrap eligibility.

			{{W|Note that this can result in certain items being disassembled when you don't want to them to}}, like the Sparbine. Make sure to mark things as important if you decide to start scrapping other objects of the same base type.

		DisplayText="Feature: Item hauling (EXPERIMENTAL)" Category="Sundries"
		 Type="Combo" Values="Disabled,Cached,All" Default="Disabled">
		<helptext>
			Implements a toggled ability that allows you to {{rules|drag things along the ground without picking them up}}, although doing so {{rules|takes a lot of time}}. Directly inspired by the feature of the same name from Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

			{{W|Disabled:}} Disable the item hauling system.
			{{W|Cached:}} You haul only objects that were beneath you when you started hauling. Moving over new ones won't include them.
			{{W|All:}} You haul all objects beneath you, even if they weren't present when you started.

			Can be freely enabled or disabled in existing saves, but doing so {{W|requires a reload}}.
