  "Description": "[b]Last tested on game version:[/b] 1.0 (build 2.0.209.43)\n\r\nSundries adds a bunch of small tweaks, improvements, and quality-of-life features to make the game smoother and reduce common points of friction while staying as unobtrusive as possible. If you've seen Minecraft mods like [url=https://quarkmod.net]Quark[/url], you'll feel right at home here.\r\n\r\nIt's designed to be [b]completely modular[/b] -- each feature Sundries adds can be individually enabled or disabled, with many tweaks including multiple implementations to enable more fine-grained controls. To make sure it doesn't result in any unwelcome surprises or changes, [b]every tweak is disabled by default[/b] so you can tailor it how you want.\r\n\r\nThis mod requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3213911728]submodule-management[/url], by kernelmethod, as a prerequisite. The mod will still load without it, but certain features won't work correctly.\r\n\r\nYou can find this mod's source code on [url=https://github.com/Ilysen/Sundries]GitHub[/url], under the GPL v3 license. If you run into any issues, you can report them here or in the repository's issue tracker.\r\n\r\n[h1]Feature list[/h1]\r\nA full list of changes added by Sundries can be found below. You can configure each one in the game's Settings menu, under the Sundries header. [b]Every feature can be safely changed in existing saves[/b], but some will only apply to new objects, and some will require you to reload the game.\r\n\r\n[h3]Block auto-collection of decorations[/h3]\r\n[b][i]Possible options:[/i][/b] Never, In Towns, Always\r\n\r\nPrevents auto-pickup from picking up metal folding chairs and plastic trees. Only applies to newly-generated objects.\r\n\r\n[h3]Block auto-collection of fresh water in towns[/h3]\r\nPrevents auto-pickup from taking fresh water from towns. It's a courtesy thing! Kyakukya needs that.\r\n\r\n[h3]Block junk from Take All[/h3]\r\nBlocks bedrolls, bones, boulders, flowers, and trash from being picked up by the Take All feature. Only applies to newly-generated objects.\r\n\r\n[h3]Disable item naming[/h3]\r\nPrevents item naming inspirations from appearing. Turn this on if you don't like those!\r\n\r\n[h3]Fully-charged energy cells appear as Max[/h3]\r\nVanilla logic displays all power cells above 75% charge as Full, even if they aren't at cap. This tweak makes cells at 100% charge appear as Max; anything between 75% and 100% still appears as Full like usual.\r\n\r\n[h3]Show math on failed Proselytize attempts[/h3]\r\nWhile enabled, failing a Proselytize against a creature will tell you the involved math, as well as the roll you need to succeed. If you're mathematically unable to Proselytize the target, it'll show you by how much.\r\n\r\n[h3]Treat all robot limbs as scrap[/h3]\r\n[b][i]Possible options:[/i][/b] None, All But Faces, Alllways\r\n\r\nVanilla logic considers every robotic limb type (arm, leg, different heads, etc) to be separate for the purposes of being treated as scrap. This tweak makes it so that marking one robotic limb as scrap will treat [i]all[/i]robotic limbs from any NPC type as scrap, with an option to preserve faces specifically.\r\n\r\n[h3]'Treat as scrap' ignores tinkering mods[/h3]\r\nBy default, every modded combination of an item is treated separately for the purposes of being scrap; for instance, marking a lacquered musket as scrap will only treat future lacquered muskets as scrap rather than every musket, for instance. This disables that behavior by checking the object's base type instead, meaning that item mods will no longer be considered when determining scrap eligibility.\r\n\r\n[b][i]Note that this can result in certain items being disassembled when you don't want to them to, most notably the Sparbine. Make sure to mark things as important if you decide to start scrapping other objects of the same base type.[/i][/b]\n\r\n[h3]Feature: Allow naming of Carbide Chef recipes[/h3]\r\nAllows you to enter custom names for your cooking recipes! Entering nothing will use a randomly-generated name like usual. This only applies to new recipes -- existing ones are unaffected.\r\n\r\n[h3]Feature: Barathrumites shelter when needed[/h3]\r\nThe Barathrumites can take shelter if required.\r\n\r\nMain quest spoilers (post-Omonporch): [spoiler]During A Call to Arms, you can speak with Otho and convince him to bring the Barathrumites to safety while you face the Putus Templar. They'll all retreat to the safety of Barathrum's study, where they won't be at risk of attack; once the quest is complete, they will return to Grit Gate properly and resume their usual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe bears will do their best to pathfind to the study, but they sometimes get stuck on each other. To mitigate this, once the Templar drop into Grit Gate, all remaining Barathrumites will be automatically teleported into the study if they aren't there already.\r\n\r\nYou can still accept the Barathrumites' help in fending off the attack if you want![/spoiler]\r\n\r\n[h3]Feature: Item hauling (EXPERIMENTAL)[/h3]\r\nImplements a toggled ability that allows you to drag things along the ground without picking them up, although doing so takes a lot of time. This is directly inspired by the feature of the same name from [url=https://cataclysmdda.org/]Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead[/url] and its forks.\r\n\r\nIncludes two behavior modes: [b]Cached[/b] (you'll only haul objects that were beneath you when you started hauling) and [b]All[/b] (you'll start hauling new objects as you move over them).\r\n\r\n[b]This feature is mostly working properly, but still has some bugs to iron out[/b] -- use it at your own risk!\r\n\r\n[h3]Feature: Mass psychometry[/h3]\r\nThe Psychometry activated ability will prompt you to perform psychometry on every valid identified object in your inventory, rather than instructing you to check the context menu and doing nothing else. This lets you learn the recipes for many items with a single action prompt. The context menu entry is still there, of course!\r\n\r\n[h1]Donations[/h1]I am not in this for the cash and I am never going to stop maintaining things even if I don't earn from them, but if you feel like giving support and have anything to spare, you can use my ko-fi link: https://ko-fi.com/ceresetal",
